# Project-Realm-Rush-Breath-First
 This is an adaptation of Section 5 of the Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D Course (https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/). Game Concept: A RTS style tower defense where enemies spawn at a point and using breath-first search find the shortest path to the player castle. The player can place towers to shoot down enemies as they travel through the world. Placing a tower on the current path of the enemies will notify all enemies and they will recalculate the shortest path. Thus players can plan out their layout actively in game. Features added beyond scope of tutorial: 1.Random spawn logic for world object to create a different map each time the player loads the game 2. Drag and drop feature for towers. 3. Second tower time with a different attack pattern To be implemented soon: 1. Camera Zoom and Panning 2. Custom enemy models with animation 3. Custom tower models 4. Custom Castle models 5.Menu and UI 6. Sound  7. Visuals with Post processing and Shader Graph
